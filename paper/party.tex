\section{Lower Bound For Empty and Full Triangles}

In an article of \emph{The American Mathematical Monthly} (REFERENCE), A. W. Goodman presents the 
following problem.

A \textbf{party} yields a graph $G$ where people are represented as vertices and two vertices are 
adjacent if those two people know eachother, i.e. are acquaintances.
A \textbf{full triangle} is a subset of three people who all know each other. In other words, three 
adjacent vertices.
An \textbf{empty triangle} is a subset of three people who are all strangers. In other words, three
non-adjacent vertices. Goodman proved the following theorem.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Theorem 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{theorem} \
    Let $E$ and $F$ be the number of empty and full triangles respectively. Then in every graph 
    with $p$ vertices
    % $$ E + F \geq \binom{p}{3} - \bfloor{ \frac{p}{2} \bfloor{ \bparen{ \frac{p-1}{2} }^2 } } $$
    \begin{equation}
        E + F \geq \binom{p}{3} - \bfloor{ \frac{p}{2} \bfloor{ \bparen{ \frac{p-1}{2} }^2 } } \label{eq:theorem1}
    \end{equation}
    and this lower bound is sharp for each positive integer $p$.
\end{theorem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Proof 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof} \
    Let $P$ be the number of partial triangles in $G$, meaning the number of triangles containing 
    exactly one or two edges. It's clear that
    \begin{equation}
        E + F + P = \binom{p}{3} \label{eq:total_triangles}.
    \end{equation}

    Let $d_i$ be the degree of a vertex $v_i$, in other words, the number of people acquainted with 
    the $i^{th}$ person. For each vertex $v_i$, picking one of their $d_i$ acquaintances and one of 
    their $p - 1 - d_i$ nonacquaintances produces a partial triangle. Thus, each $v_i$ produces 
    $d_i(p - 1 - d_i)$ partial triangles.

    Furthermore, we note that every partial triangle is counted twice in this manner. To show this
    is true, let vertex $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent $v_i$, one of their acquaintances, and one of 
    their nonacquaintances respectively. Producing a partial triangle from $v_i$ yields two cases.

    \pagebreak

    \noindent Case 1: $b$ and $c$ are not acquainted.
    Then this partial triangle is counted when $v_i$ is $a$ and $v_i$ is $b$. % add more ?

    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=.6]{../figures/partial_case_1.pdf}
        \caption{A visualization of Case 1.}
    \end{figure}

    \noindent Case 2: $b$ and $c$ are acquainted.
    Then this partial triangle is counted when $v_i$ is $a$ and $v_i$ is $c$.

    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=.6]{../figures/partial_case_2.pdf}
        \caption{A visualization of Case 2.}
    \end{figure}
    In both cases, the partial triangle is counted twice, which follows for every partial triangle.
    Consequently,
    \begin{equation}
        P = \frac{1}{2} \sum^{p}_{i=1}{d_i(p - 1 - d_i)} \label{eq:partial_triangles}.
    \end{equation}

    Looking back at Equation (\ref{eq:total_triangles}), we can minimize $E + F$ by maximizing $P$.
    To maximize $P$, we must maximize the sum in Equation (\ref{eq:partial_triangles}). We can view 
    each term of the sum as a quadratic function of $d_i$. After finding the derivative of the 
    equation it's clear that we attain our maximum when $d_i = \frac{p - 1}{2}$. 
    
    However, this is a contradiction when $p$ is even since $d_i$ is an integer.
    Thus, if $p$ is odd, we attain the maximum value of $\frac{(p - 1)^2}{4}$ for each term when 
    $d_i = \frac{p - 1}{2}$. If $p$ is even, we attain the maximum possible value of 
    $\frac{p(p - 2)}{4}$ for each term when $d_i = \frac{p}{2}$ or $d_i = \frac{p - 2}{2}$.
    In either case, we can express the maximum value as
    $$ \bfloor{ \bparen{ \frac{p - 1}{2} }^2 }, $$
    and so
    \begin{equation}
        P \leq \frac{1}{2} \sum^{p}_{i=1}{ \bfloor{ \bparen{ \frac{p - 1}{2} }^2 } } 
            = \frac{p}{2} \bfloor{ \bparen{ \frac{p - 1}{2} }^2 }. \label{eq:partial_max}
    \end{equation}
    But since $P$ is an integer, we can strengthen this to read
    \begin{equation}
        P \leq \bfloor{\frac{p}{2} \bfloor{ \bparen{ \frac{p - 1}{2} }^2 }}. \label{eq:p_max}
    \end{equation}
    Equations (\ref{eq:total_triangles}) and (\ref{eq:p_max}) now yield our desired bound:
    \begin{equation}
        E + F = \binom{p}{3} - P \geq \binom{p}{3} - \bfloor{\frac{p}{2} \bfloor{ \bparen{ \frac{p - 1}{2} }^2 }}. \label{eq:bound}
    \end{equation}

    Next, for each $p$, we must find a graph $G_p$ attaining this bound. But equality in Equation 
    (\ref{eq:theorem1}) is equivalent to equality in Equation (\ref{eq:p_max}) which occurs only 
    when
    \begin{equation}
        P = \frac{1}{2} \sum^{p}_{i=1}{d_i(p - 1 - d_i)} 
            = \bfloor{\frac{p}{2} \bfloor{ \bparen{ \frac{p - 1}{2} }^2 }}. \label{eq:max_desired}
    \end{equation}
    % picture of complete bigraph ?
    If $p=2n$ for some integer $n$, let $G_p$ be the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$. Now $G_p$ 
    is regular of degree $n$, and we must check that Equation (\ref{eq:max_desired}) is satisfied.
    \begin{align*}
        P &= \frac{1}{2} \sum^{p}_{i=1}{d_i(p - 1 - d_i)} & P &= \bfloor{\frac{p}{2} \bfloor{ \bparen{ \frac{p - 1}{2} }^2 }} \notag \\
          &= \frac{1}{2} \sum^{2n}_{i=1}{n(2n - 1 - n)}   &   &= \bfloor{\frac{2n}{2} \bfloor{ \bparen{ \frac{2n - 1}{2} }^2 }} \notag \\
          &= \frac{1}{2} \sum^{2n}_{i=1}{n^2 - n}         &   &= \bfloor{ n \bfloor{ \frac{4n^2 - 4n + 1}{4} }} \notag \\
          &= \frac{1}{2} (2n^3 - 2n^2)                    &   &= \bfloor{ n \bfloor{ n^2 - n + \frac{1}{4} }} \notag \\
          &= n^3 - n^2                                    &   &= \bfloor{ n(n^2 - n) }  \notag \\
          &                                               &   &= \bfloor{ n^3 - n^2 } \notag \\
          &                                               &   &= n^3 - n^2 \notag
    \end{align*}
    We can see that Equation (\ref{eq:max_desired}) holds when $p=2n$.

    \end{figure}

    If $p=2n+1$, the construction of $G_p$ is a bit more involved. As depicted for $p=9$ in Figure 
    (\ref{fig:g}), we start with $K_{n,n}$ with its vertices labeled $u_1, u_2,...,u_n$; $v_1, v_2,...,v_n$ 
    and we subdivide edge $u_iv_i$ for $i \leq \frac{n}{2}$. We now obtain $G_p$ by using these 
    $\floor{\frac{n}{2}}$ subdivision points to form a single vertex labeled $w$. We observe that 
    $G_p$ has $2n$ vertices of degree $n$ and one vertex of degree $2\floor{\frac{n}{2}}$. It is 
    routine to check that Equation (\ref{eq:max_desired}) is satisfied.
    \begin{align*}
        P &= \frac{1}{2} \sum^{p}_{i=1}{d_i(p - 1 - d_i)}                                                      & P &= \bfloor{\frac{p}{2} \bfloor{ \bparen{ \frac{p - 1}{2} }^2 }} \notag \\
          &= \frac{1}{2} \sum^{2n+1}_{i=1}{d_i(2n - d_i)}                                                      &   &= \bfloor{\frac{2n+1}{2} \bfloor{ \bparen{ \frac{2n + 1 - 1}{2} }^2 }} \notag \\
          &= \frac{1}{2} \bparen{\sum^{2n}_{i=1}{n(2n - n)} + 2\floor{\frac{n}{2}}(2n - 2\floor{\frac{n}{2}})} &   &= \bfloor{\frac{2n+1}{2} \bfloor{ n^2 }} \notag \\
          &= \frac{1}{2} \bparen{\sum^{2n}_{i=1}{n^2} + 2\floor{\frac{n}{2}}(2n - 2\floor{\frac{n}{2}})}       &   &= \bfloor{\bparen{\frac{2n+1}{2}} n^2} \notag \\
          &= \frac{1}{2} \bparen{2n^3 + 2\floor{\frac{n}{2}}(2n - 2\floor{\frac{n}{2}})}                       &   &= \bfloor{\frac{2n^3+n^2}{2}}  \notag \\
          &                                                                                                    &   &= \bfloor{ n^3 + \frac{1}{2}n^2 } \notag
    \end{align*}
    At this point, we run into two cases.

    \pagebreak

    \noindent Case 1: $n$ is even. Let $n = 2t$ for some integer $t$.

    \begin{align*}

\section{Lower Bound For Full Triangles} % give a better section name

In a different article of \emph{The American Mathematical Monthly} (REFERENCE),
L. Suave noted that a when $p$ is even, $E + F$ can be minimized while keeping $F = 0$. However, 
when $p$ is odd and greater than seven, $F > 0$ for all graphs attaining the minimum for $E + F$.
We will now refine this result.

    In every graph attaining the minimum possible value for E + F,

                \end{cases} \label{eq:theorem2}
    \end{equation}
    and this lower bound is sharp for each positive integer $p$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Proof 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof} \
    We first observe that this bound is attained by the graphs $G_p$ constructed in the first 
    proof. If $p = 2n$, then $G_p = K_{n, n}$ which obviously has no full triangles. If 
    $p = 4n +1$ or $p = 4n + 3$, we notice that $G_p - w$ is a bigraph, which has no full triangles.
    Thus, every full triangle of $G_p$ has the form $u_i, v_j, w$. But recalling the construction
    of $G_p$, we see that this will be a full triangle if and only if $i \le n$, $j \le n$, and 
    $i \neq j$. Consequently, $G_p$ has $F = n(n - 1)$ full triangles as desired.

    It remains to be shown that the bound in Equation (\ref{eq:theorem2}) cannot be violated. If 
    $p$ is even, then this is trivial, since we cannot have a negative number of full triangles. If 
    $p$ is odd and $n = 0$ or $n = 1$, then this is also trivial, since $n(n - 1) = 0$. Therefore,
    we will assume $n \ge 2$.

    \noindent Case 1: $p = 4n + 1$

    Let $H$ be a graph minimizing $E + F$ with the smallest value of $F$. We will assume $F \le n(n - 1)$
    and show that the bound cannot be violated. A vertex in $H$ lies in an average of $\frac{3F}{4n + 1}$ 
    full triangles, that is, the number of vertices that lie in a full triangle over the total number
    of vertices. Thus, there exists a vertex $v_0$ that lies in $t$ full triangles where
    \begin{equation}
        t \le \frac{3F}{4n + 1} \le \frac{3n(n - 1)}{4n + 1} < n - 1 \label{eq:t_case_1}.
    \end{equation}

    Since $t$ and $n$ are integers, we can rewrite this to be $t \le n - 2$. Let $V$ be the vertex set 
    of $H$, let $A$ be the set of vertices adjacent to $v_0$ and let $B$ be the vertices not adjacent to
    $v_0$.

    Recall the construction of $G_p$ in the first proof, in order to minimize $E + F$, $H$ must 
    satisfy Equation (\ref{eq:max_desired}) by being a regular graph of degree $2n$. Consequently, 
    there are $2n$ vertices in both $A$ and $B$. Since $v_0$
    lies in $t$ full triangles, there are $t$ edges whose endpoints both lie within $A$.

    Now, we know the sum of the degrees of the vertices in $A$ is $4n^2$, we know all $2n$ 
    vertices in $A$ are adjacent to $v_0$, and we know $2t$ vertices in $A$ are adjacent to 
    another vertex within $A$. Thus, there must be $4n^2 - 2n - 2t$ edges joining sets $A$ and $B$. 
    
    Furthermore, there must be $4n^2 - (4n^2 - 2n - 2t) = 2n + 2t$ vertices in $B$ that are adjacent 
    to another vertex in $B$ since no vertex in $B$ is adjacent to $v_0$. Hence, there are 
    $n + t$ edges whose endpoints both lie within $B$.

    Consider an edge $x$ within set $B$. Its two endpoints are incident with $4n - 2$ other edges. 
    Of those edges, at most $n + t - 1$ of them can lie within $B$. Thus, at least 
    $4n - 2 - (n + t - 1) = 3n - t - 1$ edges have an endpoint in $A$. Note that no vertex in 
    $A$ can lie on more than 2 of these edges because that would result in a double edge, and 
    recall that $A$ has $2n$ vertices. Therefore, we can conclude that at least 
    $(3n - t - 1) - 2n = n - t - 1$ vertices in $A$ lie on exactly two of these edges. Each of 
    these vertices forms a full triangle containing the edge $x$.

    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=.7]{../figures/abb_triangle.pdf}
        \caption{A visualization of an $ABB$ triangle, other edges are omitted.}
    \end{figure}

    Thus, each edge within $B$ lies in at least $n - t - 1$ full $ABB$ triangles, and so $H$ should 
    contain at least $(n + t)(n - t - 1)$ full $ABB$ triangles.
    Similarly, consider an edge $y$ within set $A$. Its two endpoints are incident with $4n - 2$ other
    edges. Of those edges, we know that two of them have $v_0$ as an endpoint and at most $t - 1$ of 
    them lie within $A$. Thus, at least $4n - 2 - (2 + (t - 1)) = 4n - t - 3$ edges have an endpoint 
    in $B$. Recall that no vertex in $B$ can lie on more than two of these edges and $B$ has $2n$ 
    vertices. Consequently, at least $(4n - t - 3) - 2n = 2n - t - 3$ vertices in $B$ lie on 
    exactly two of these edges. Each of these vertices forms a full triangle containing the edge $y$.

    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=.7]{../figures/aab_triangle.pdf}
        \caption{A visualization of an $AAB$ triangle, other edges are omitted.}
    \end{figure}

    Thus, each edge within $A$ lies in at least $2n - t - 3$ full $AAB$ triangles, and so $H$ should 
    contain at least $t(2n - t - 3)$ full $AAB$ triangles.

    Recall that $v_0$ lies on $t$ full triangles. We can add these to the sum of the two bounds that
    we found above to conclude that
    $$ F \ge t + (n + t)(n - t - 1) + t(2n - t - 3) = n^2 - n + 2t(n - t - \frac{3}{2}). $$
    Finally, since $0 \le t \le n - 2$ and $n \ge 2$, we conclude that $F \ge n^2 - n$.

    \noindent Case 2: $p = 4n + 3$

    As in Case 1, we let $H$ be a graph minimizing $E + F$ with the smallest value of $F$. We 
    will still assume $F \le n(n - 1)$ and again show that the bound cannot be violated. Recall 
    the construction of $G_p$ in the first proof, in order to minimize $E + F$, $H$ must satisfy
    Equation (\ref{eq:max_desired}) by having $4n + 2$ vertices of degree $2n + 1$ and one vertex 
    $w$ of degree $2n$ or $2n + 2$.
    
    Note that a graph with an odd number of vertices cannot be regular 
    with odd degree (REFERENCE). We will go ahead and assume $w$ has degree $2n$, for if it were 
    $2n + 2$, we could just remove edges incident with $w$ until we have a graph $H'$ with the desired 
    degrees and $F' \le F$ full triangles.

    We continue to repeat the steps in Case 1 by selecting a vertex $v_0$ which does not lie in too
    many full triangles. However, the posibility that $v_0 = w$ is troublesome. Consequently, we select 
    $v_0$ to be a point of degree $2n + 1$ lying in an average of $\frac{3F}{4n + 3}$ 
    full triangles, which is the number of vertices that lie in a full triangle over the total number
    of vertices. Recall that $n \ge 2$, so
    \begin{equation}
        t \le \frac{3F}{4n + 3} \le \frac{3n(n - 1)}{4n + 3} < n - 1 \label{eq:t_case_2}.
    \end{equation}

    Since $t$ and $n$ are integers, we can again rewrite this to be $t \le n - 2$. Furthermore, we 
    will define sets $A$ and $B$ the same way that we defined them in Case 1, but now they both contain 
    $2n + 1$ vertices. We will now repeat a similar counting process for the number of full triangles 
    in $H$. However, we must consider two subcases depending on the location of $w$.

    \noindent Subcase i: $w$ is in $A$

    Then $A$ has $2n$ vertices of degree $2n + 1$ and it has vertex $w$, which has a degree of $2n$. 
    Additionally, $v_0$ lies in $t$ full triangles, so there are $t$ edges whose endpoints both 
    lie within $A$. To add, $B$ has $2n + 1$ vertices of degree $2n + 1$.

    Hence, the sum of the degrees of the vertices in $A$ is $4n^2 + 4n$, all $2n + 1$ vertices 
    in $A$ are adjacent to $v_0$, and $2t$ vertices in $A$ are adjacent to another vertex 
    within $A$. Thus, there must be $4n^2 + 4n - (2n + 1) - 2t = 4n^2 + 2n - 2t - 1$ edges 
    joining sets $A$ and $B$.

    Then there must be $4n^2 + 4n + 1 - (4n^2 + 2n - 2t - 1) = 2n + 2t + 2$ vertices in $B$ 
    that are adjacent to another vertex in $B$ since no vertex in $B$ is adjacent to $v_0$. 
    Hence, there are $n + t + 1$ edges whose endpoints both lie within $B$.

    Consider an edge $x$ within set $B$. Its two endpoints are incident with $4n + 2 - 2$ other edges. 
    Of those edges, at most $n + t$ of them can lie within $B$. Thus, at least 
    $4n - (n + t) = 3n - t$ edges have an endpoint in $A$. Recall that no vertex in $A$ can lie 
    on more than two of these edges and $A$ has $2n + 1$ vertices. Therefore, we can conclude that 
    at least $(3n - t) - (2n + 1) = n - t - 1$ vertices in $A$ lie on exactly two of these edges. Each of 
    these vertices forms a full triangle containing the edge $x$.
    Thus, each edge within $B$ lies in at least $n - t - 1$ full $ABB$ triangles, and so $H$ should 
    contain at least $(n + t + 1)(n - t - 1)$ full $ABB$ triangles.

    Similarly, consider an edge $y$ within set $A$. Its two endpoints are incident with at least
    $((2n + 1) + 2n) - 2 = 4n - 1$ other edges. Of those edges, we know that two of them have $v_0$ as 
    an endpoint and at most $t - 1$ of them lie within $A$. Thus, at least 
    $4n - 1 - (2 + (t - 1)) = 4n - t - 2$ edges have an endpoint in $B$. Recall that no vertex in $B$ 
    can lie on more than two of these edges and $B$ has $2n + 1$ vertices. Consequently, at least 
    $(4n - t - 2) - (2n + 1) = 2n - t - 3$ vertices in $B$ lie on exactly two of these edges. Each of 
    these vertices forms a full triangle containing the edge $y$.
    Thus, each edge within $A$ lies in at least $2n - t - 3$ full $AAB$ triangles, and so $H$ should 
    contain at least $t(2n - t - 3)$ full $AAB$ triangles. 
    
    Recall that $v_0$ lies on $t$ full triangles. We can add these to the sum of the two bounds that
    we found above to conclude that
    $$ F \ge t + (n + t + 1)(n - t - 1) + t(2n - t - 3) = n^2 - 1 + 2t(n - t - 2). $$
    As a result, since $0 \le t \le n - 2$ and $n \ge 2$, we conclude that $F \ge n^2 - n$.

    \noindent Subcase ii: $w$ is in $B$

    Then $B$ has $2n$ vertices of degree $2n + 1$ and it has vertex $w$, which has a degree of $2n$. 
    It follows that $A$ has $2n + 1$ vertices of degree $2n + 1$. Additionally, $v_0$ lies in $t$ 
    full triangles, so there are $t$ edges whose endpoints both lie within $A$.

    Hence, the sum of the degrees of the vertices in $A$ is $4n^2 + 4n + 1$, all $2n + 1$ vertices 
    in $A$ are adjacent to $v_0$, and $2t$ vertices in $A$ are adjacent to another vertex 
    within $A$. Thus, there must be $4n^2 + 4n + 1 - (2n + 1) - 2t = 4n^2 + 2n - 2t$ edges 
    joining sets $A$ and $B$.

    Then there must be $4n^2 + 4n - (4n^2 + 2n - 2t) = 2n + 2t$ vertices in $B$ 
    that are adjacent to another vertex in $B$ since no vertex in $B$ is adjacent to $v_0$. 
    Hence, there are $n + t$ edges whose endpoints both lie within $B$.

    Consider an edge $x$ within set $B$. Its two endpoints are incident with at least
    $4n + 1 - 2$ other edges. Of those edges, at most $n + t - 1$ of them can lie within $B$. 
    Thus, at least $4n - 1 - (n + t - 1) = 3n - t$ edges have an endpoint in $A$. Recall that 
    no vertex in $A$ can lie on more than two of these edges and $A$ has $2n + 1$ vertices. 
    Therefore, we can conclude that at least $(3n - t) - (2n + 1) = n - t - 1$ vertices in $A$ 
    lie on exactly two of these edges. Each of these vertices forms a full triangle containing 
    the edge $x$.
    Thus, each edge within $B$ lies in at least $n - t - 1$ full $ABB$ triangles, and so $H$ should 
    contain at least $(n + t)(n - t - 1)$ full $ABB$ triangles.

    Similarly, consider an edge $y$ within set $A$. Its two endpoints are incident with 
    $4n + 2 - 2 = 4n$ other edges. Of those edges, we know that two of them have $v_0$ as 
    an endpoint and at most $t - 1$ of them lie within $A$. Thus, at least 
    $4n - (2 + (t - 1)) = 4n - t - 1$ edges have an endpoint in $B$. Recall that no vertex in $B$ 
    can lie on more than two of these edges and $B$ has $2n + 1$ vertices. Consequently, at least 
    $(4n - t - 1) - (2n + 1) = 2n - t - 2$ vertices in $B$ lie on exactly two of these edges. Each of 
    these vertices forms a full triangle containing the edge $y$.
    Thus, each edge within $A$ lies in at least $2n - t - 2$ full $AAB$ triangles, and so $H$ should 
    contain at least $t(2n - t - 2)$ full $AAB$ triangles. 
    
    Recall that $v_0$ lies on $t$ full triangles. We can add these to the sum of the two bounds that
    we found above to conclude that
    $$ F \ge t + (n + t)(n - t - 1) + t(2n - t - 2) = n^2 - n + 2t(n - t - 1). $$
    As a result, since $0 \le t \le n - 2$ and $n \ge 2$, we conclude that $F \ge n^2 - n$.
    In all cases, the bound $F \ge n^2 - n$ cannot be violated when $p$ is odd.

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we observe that when $p$ is even, many graphs attain the bound in Theorem 2. Conversely,
not many graphs attain that bound when $p$ is odd. In fact, it is even argued that $G_p$ is the unique 
graph attaining that bound, but the proof is too long to include here.

NOTE: I didn't have time to add my references but I will be sure to add them in.
